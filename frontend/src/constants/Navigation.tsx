/**
 * TODO:
 * When developing locally (on your computer) this should be http://localhost:8080
 *
 * When you deploy, modify this constant to point to the URL of your backend.
 * It should be of the format "https://<app-name>.fly.dev/api"
 *
 * Most of the time, the name of your app is the name of the folder you're in
 * right now, and the name of your Git repository.
 * For instance, if that name is "my-app", then you should set this to:
 * "https://my-app.fly.dev/api"
 *
 * If you've already deployed your app (using `fly launch` or `fly deploy`),
 * you can find the name by running `flyctl status`, under App > Name.
